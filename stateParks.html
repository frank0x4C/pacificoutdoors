          <h3>Washington State Parks</h3>
          <p>Every year, almost 40 million people visit Washington’s 124 state parks.
            With over 400 miles of hiking trails and locations in every corner of the state —
            from Peace Arch Historical State Park in the northwest to Fort Columbia Historical State Park
            in the southwest, to Crawford State Park Heritage Site in the northeast and Fields Spring State Park
            in the southeast — these parks provide unique recreation activities for all. Washington is lucky —
            at 106 years old, our state park system is one of the oldest in the country. Older, in fact,
            than the National Park system. And though the state is similar in size to Utah,
            we have just about the triple the state parks. And forget your typical definition of park.
            Ours are diverse in both in type (cultural, recreational, historical, geological) and variety
            (marine parks, ocean front, steppe shrub, mountainous, old growth forest to name a few).

                 set of steps from the main day-use area adjacent to the parking lot.
                 The second, at the end of a paved interpretive path, tells the story
                  of the secluded canyon. Both the interpretive path and gravel
                  secondary parking area lead to the third and highest viewpoint,
                  the Fryxell Overlook, offering panoramic views of the falls and Palouse River Canyon.
