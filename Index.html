            state parks have you covered. No one knows that better than State Park Commissioner Mark O. Brown,
             all 124 in his first six years as commissioner. “There’s iconic Native American rock art at Columbia
             Hills, an astronomical observatory in Goldendale. There’s entire mountains, pieces of significant
             military history. One of the most complete coastal fortifications left standing at Fort Columbia;
             one of the most complete lighthouse keep compounds on the West Coast at Cape Disappointment.
             We have cabins and yurts, mountain top lookouts, campgrounds, lakes, rivers. Unique geological
             features like Beacon Rock State Park and Steamboat Rock near Grand Coulee.”
