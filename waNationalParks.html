      <h3><a href="https://www.nps.gov/olym/index.htm">Olympic National Park</a></h3>
      <p id="olympic-park">
      With its incredible range of precipitation and elevation, diversity is the hallmark of Olympic National Park.
      Encompassing nearly a million acres, the park protects a vast wilderness, thousands of years of
      human history, and several distinctly different ecosystems, including glacier-capped mountains,
      old-growth temperate rain forests, and over 70 miles of wild coastline.<br><br>
      Olympic National Park is an American national park located in the State of Washington,
      on the Olympic Peninsula. The park has four regions: the Pacific coastline, alpine areas,
      the west side temperate rainforest and the forests of the drier east side.
      Within the park there are three distinct ecosystems which are subalpine forest and wildflower meadow,
      temperate forest, and the rugged Pacific coast.

      <h3><a href="https://www.nps.gov/mora/index.htm">Mount Ranier National Park</a></h3>
      <p id="ranier-park">
        Ascending to 14,410 feet above sea level, Mount Rainier stands as an icon in the Washington landscape.
        An active volcano, Mount Rainier is the most glaciated peak in the contiguous U.S.A.,
        spawning five major rivers. Subalpine wildflower meadows ring the icy volcano while ancient forest
        cloaks Mount Rainier’s lower slopes. Wildlife abounds in the park’s ecosystems. A lifetime of discovery
        awaits.<br><br>
        In the summer, permits can be obtained at any ranger station in the park during their hours of operation.
        Obtain permits at the Longmire Wilderness Information Center at Longmire, the Jackson Visitor Center at
        Paradise, the Ohanapecosh Visitor Center at Ohanapecosh, the White River Wilderness Information Center at
        the White River Entrance, the Sunrise Visitor Center at Sunrise, and the Carbon River Ranger Station
        located 2.5 miles before the Carbon River Entrance. Some of these facilities close seasonally, so make sure
        to check the hours of operation before visiting.

      <h3><a href="https://www.nps.gov/noca/index.htm">North Cascades National Park</a></h3>
      <p id="cascade-park">
        Less than three hours from Seattle, an alpine landscape beckons. Discover communities of life
        adapted to moisture in the west and recurring fire in the east. Explore jagged peaks crowned by more
        than 300 glaciers. Listen to cascading waters in forested valleys. Witness a
        landscape sensitive to the Earth's changing climate. Help steward the ecological heart of the Cascades.<br><br>
        There are countless backcountry routes and possibilities in this wild land. The diversity of climate and
        geography creates very different habitats on the west and east side of the crest, as well as fostering a
        great array of plants and animals. Cascading water is fed by over 300 glaciers and countless snowfields.
        Lakes are abundant. Almost 400 miles (644 km) of trails, mostly in major drainages and over high passes,
        traverse this tremendous landscape. Your path may follow a route used for many centuries by people who have
        long crossed these mountains or sought food and resources here, or you may venture to an area so wild it
        feels as if you are the first explorer.
